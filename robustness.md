# Be Liberal In What You Accept

Implementers will make mistakes, implementers will need to break compliance. You can't just say "it's invalid, throw everything away" when things don't work exactly the way you want (unless you're a serialization format, in which case that signals data corruption).

Be Pragmatic. State what should happen when the spec has to degrade. Explain your reasoning. Show your work, and *do* let other students copy off your paper (as long as they don't put your name on it).
