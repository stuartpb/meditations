# Security Through Transparency

The best path to security is to make it fault-tolerant. If you have a good recovery plan for lockout and loss, that means the only remaining long-term threat can come from breach.

The only systems immune to breach are ones where there's nothing *to* breach. The best kept secrets are the ones that aren't important.

Information is fire, and like thermodynamics, its entropy cannot be reversed. If you plan for a world where everybody eventually knows everything, you're a lot closer to reality than a world where you can keep your ruinous genies forever bottled.
