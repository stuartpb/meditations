# The Lethal Dosage of Consistency

> Consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds.

Worshipping at the altar of consistency is more likely to leave you stuck down a dead end, as you won't have room to pivot into anything that *doesn't fit* within your "consistent" world.

Look how screwed JavaScript was after everybody had decided that Promises were the One True Pattern for async, getting language-level adoption - and then realizing that the Promise design didn't have any room for cancellation.

If they'd just kept it loose, sure, people would have kept on needing wrappers and adapters - but there still would have been room for experimentation, for finding even *better* practices. By saying "this is it", you're really saying "if anything better comes along, it'll have to abandon us", and some day, you might just get your wish.

There are certainly *scopes* that, within your control, should remain consistent - but you shouldn't believe that there's any nobility in imposing consistency on the *outside world*.
