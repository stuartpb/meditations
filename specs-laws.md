# No Spec is Law

No matter who makes whatever declaration, or how emphatically they make it, they will always be secondary to the *true* laws: [the rules that must be followed to interoperate with the systems you need to work with][HN]. These may be unwritten rules, outside of the emergent properties of the source code that necessitates them; they may just be following the precise letter of a well-designed standard.

The *real* skill of a talented programmer is to recognize which rules fall under the purview of these laws, and when the purview shifts. (Twelve years ago, the herald of Web law was not the W3C nor WICG, but the intersection of IE6's feature support with the adoption curve of Flash. In 2015, following those laws'd be likely to leave you banished from anything Apple sells that starts with an "i".)
