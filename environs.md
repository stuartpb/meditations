# We Are Our Context

Humans are an adaptable species. Everything we do, we do as products of our environment - and that product is HIGHLY dynamic.

We're not "baked" at some point in our childhoods or our adolescence or our thirties or ever. Someone who's been one type of person in one place for years can change to something entirely different when dropped into a new context.

(I'm not saying you HAVE to be dropped into a new context to change, but I DO think most significant change needs to be accompanied by something external - even if it's just how people respond to you.)
