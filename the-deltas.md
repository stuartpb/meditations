# On Growing Up

I don't really buy into the "oh, you'll think that way when you're your age, and nobody can convince you otherwise, you'll just have to grow out of it" patronizing crap talk.

I think most people who say that either a) never really *grew* out of what they're talking about (they just abandoned their old views because they were unfashionable and left them pitted up in denial at the root of their soul), or b) just suck at introspection and communication.

One of the principles I have when it comes to growing on any stance is that I haven't really *grown* if I couldn't, if presented with a younger iteration of myself, talk the younger self into taking my stance. It involves being in touch with what I was dissatisfied with, and how I satisfied that - and that sometimes, I picked something that satisfied something smaller that left me unsatisfied somewhere larger.

That is generally the strategy my explanations take: find the thing I cared about that I didn't realize I cared about, pick the broken and unhealthy stacks off from on top of that, and then relay the clearer views to build on top of what was just as clear then as now.

And, of course, sometimes I can't be sure I remember my younger self's understandings so accurately, and there's call to cover my bases. Hence explanations of things that lie close to that untouched core of clarity, like this. Not everybody's a younger me.

(The same goes for more concrete stuff like how HTML or Git works, too.)
