# Encrypted Media Extensions: A Necessary Evil As Of 2016

EME is a blemish on the face of the web platform, a pimple, a zit.

It's a zit we should *absolutely not pop*.

EME keeps Netflix on the Web. Without EME, the alternative isn't that Netflix embraces open content - it's that Netflix ditches the web, or at least ditches the open and interoperable web.

If you root for EME, you're probably in favor of fighting the hegemony of any one browser. Well, guess what? A post-EME world sees mega-corporations like Microsoft signing deals with Netflix to bundle *vendor-specific* DRM into their browser - you know, the way it was *before* EME, with Silverlight in IE. This was one of those things that kept IE *alive* in the face of being a massive failure in so many other areas.

The EME zit is the protective bubble within which our W3C antibodies contain and fight the establishment's ludicrous demands for antagonizing allies in their audience. If that bubble pops, this infection will not disappear: it will *spread*, breaking out into a *full-blown rash*.

Let's hold off on cutting EME until we've solved enough problems with web video infrastructure and usability that DRM video is plainly an impediment to competition, the way DRM on music eventually faded from practicality. Trying to do it *before* will only be disasterous.
