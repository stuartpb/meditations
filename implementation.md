# Work With The Implementation

A spec without an implementation is just a pipe dream - just saying "everybody will agree on everything forever" doesn't fix anything.

Start working on an implementation, even just a polyfill, as early as possible (making sure to keep that implementation in sync with your proposed spec - a divergent implementation at this stage is going to make things so much worse).
