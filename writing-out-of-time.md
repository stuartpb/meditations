# Writing Like You're Dying

My writing's so messy and chaotic and unpolished because I've only got so much time to live, and I've got a LOT to say. Maybe once I've finished writing it all, I'll go back and spend some time doing a second pass to edit everything and make it polished, but I fully expect to be dead well before then.

(Not that I even necessarily expect to be dead any time soon - it's just that I've got a LOT of stuff I haven't finished writing, especially when it comes to the stuff I haven't *started* writing, and the stuff I haven't *realized I want to start* yet.)

This is also why I'm not mad when I find out that someone's written a more comprehensive take on an idea I've had. Good - one less thing on my plate, more time to tackle all this *other* useful stuff that *nobody* is writing well enough. Hell, if enough people start chipping in and chipping away at some dedicated efforts on parts of all this, maybe I'll even get to doing that second pass. (This is why I'm so obsessed with extending my privilege out there to the less-priviliged, incidentally. That's the only way we're going to get enough good writers actually writing to get this full body of work into existence.)
