# Have Some Humanity

I, like many young men trying to make sense of the senselessly vicious capitalistic dystopia that is modern America, went through a regrettably Darwinian worldview in my post-high-school years.

Moving on from this for me didn't really click until I read Dawkins' foreword to The Selfish Gene, along with some of David Wong's work on Cracked.

Our humanity is what makes us human, the mechanism that gives us primacy on this planet. We beat the beasts of this world because we can act more abstractly than primitive might-makes-right impulses.

Trying to "undo" our socially-dictated boundaries and assert a "natural order" to the world is to counterproduce all the complex natures that worked so well to get us to this point so far.
