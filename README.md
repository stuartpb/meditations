This repo is where I'm saying things where I have something to say about them, apropos of (more or less) nothing. Synthesizing full-length articles is hard, and most of the time I feel like it'd just be diluting the impact of the kernel of the matter.

This was originally supposed to be a set of guidelines surrounding the drafting of technical specifications, but as it sprawls in scope, it can also be interpreted as a set of guidelines around any sort of design, and, in a broader interpretation, as [an abstract philosophy of life][ZAMM] (with shout-outs to the driving philosophies of others).

All opinions expressed are my own, except the Robustness Principle was Jon Postel's.

Also cribbing from [The Design of Everyday Things][] and [The Pragmatic Programmer][].
