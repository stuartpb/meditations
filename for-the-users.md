# The Pragmatic Prime Directive: Serve the Use Cases

The ultimate point of any spec is [Taking Care of Business][]. Your spec needs to make **real people**'s *real lives* **really easier**. Nobody wants a spec that tells them how to do something they already do, but more painfully and less effectively.

Know your use cases, know your scope, know your prior art. Realize that [you're not the first one to notice these problems][SPACEWAR] (and that there's [still lots of yet-untapped potential for better solutions][cluetrain]).

Don't let the fear of [trodden ground in and of itself][xkcd 927] dissuade you; only know that from a solid understanding of the chaos that came before [has meaningful order ever emerged][xkcd 927 fixed].
